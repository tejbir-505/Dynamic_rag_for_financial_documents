products, O-Cel-O™ Sponges; protective material products, such as Scotchgard™ Fabric Protectors; certain maintenance-free respirators;
certain consumer retail personal safety products, including safety glasses, hearing protectors, and 3M Thinsulate™ Insulation, which is used
in jackets, pants, gloves, hats and boots to keep people warm; Nexcare™ Adhesive Bandages; and ACE® branded (and related brands)
elastic bandage, supports and thermometer product lines.
<2> Distribution
3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers,
jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world.
<3> Management believes the confidence of
wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products — a confidence developed through long association with
skilled marketing and sales representatives — has contributed significantly to 3M’s position in the marketplace and to its growth.
<4> Research and Patents
Research and product development constitutes an important part of 3M’s activities and has been a major driver of 3M’s sales and profit
growth.
<5> Research, development and related expenses totaled $1.735 billion in 2016, $1.763 billion in 2015 and $1.770 billion in 2014.
<6> Research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $1.225 billion in 2016, $1.223 billion in 2015 and $1.193 billion in 2014.
<7> Related expenses
primarily include technical support; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and
maintain patents; amortization of externally acquired patents and externally acquired in-process research and development; and gains/losses
associated with certain corporate approved investments in R&D-related ventures, such as equity method effects and impairments.
<8> The Company’s products are sold around the world under various trademarks.
<9> The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous
U.S. and foreign patents.
<10> The Company’s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by
new patents.
<11> Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent
grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.
<12> The actual protection afforded by a patent,
which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in
the country.
<13> The Company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses.
<14> In general, no single patent or
group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company’s business segments.
<15> The importance of
patents in the Electronics and Energy segment is described in “Performance by Business Segment” — “Electronics and Energy Business” in
Part II, Item 7, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
<16> Raw Materials
In 2016, the Company experienced declining costs for most raw material categories and transportation fuel, due largely to price decreases in
crude oil and the derivative chemical feedstock markets.
<17> This in turn drove year-on-year cost decreases in many feedstock categories,
including petroleum based materials, minerals, metals and wood pulp based products.
<18> To date, the Company is receiving sufficient
quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements.
<19> It is impossible to predict future shortages of raw
materials or the impact any such shortages would have.
<20> 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources.
<21> 3M manages spend
category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.
<22> Environmental Law Compliance
3M’s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world.
<23> 3M has made, and plans to
continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws.
<24> 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to
environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to “Environmental Matters and Litigation” in Note 14, Commitments and
Contingencies).
<25> 7

Table of Contents
Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed.
<26> Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and
reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company’s commitment to a plan of action, or
approval by regulatory agencies.
<27> Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are
capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
<28> In 2016, 3M expended about $28 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment.
<29> This amount excludes expenditures for
remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are
expensed.
<30> Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices — such as wastewater treatment plant
improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers — at new and existing facilities constructed
or upgraded in the normal course of business.
<31> Consistent with the Company’s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital
expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $70 million over the next two years
for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
<32> While the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for
environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or
competitive position.
<33> Executive Officers
Following is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other
positions they have held during the past five years.
<34> No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is there
any undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
Item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
<38> The Company may
also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to
shareholders and in press releases.
<39> In addition, the Company’s representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
<40> Forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the Company’s expected future business and financial performance.
<41> Words such as “plan,” “expect,” “aim,” “believe,” “project,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “will,” “should,” “could,”
“forecast” and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements.
<42> In particular, these include,
among others, statements relating to:
· the Company’s strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial
performance, and market position,
· worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial
conditions of our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the
Company or our suppliers and customers,
· new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,
· the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,
· the outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,
· future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,
· future availability of and access to credit markets,
· pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions,
· asset impairments,
· tax liabilities,
· information technology security, and
· the effects of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations in the United States and other countries in which we
operate.
<43> The Company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
<44> Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and
uncertainties.
<45> Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking
statements depending on a variety of factors.
<46> Important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among
others, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the headings of “Overview,”
“Financial Condition and Liquidity” and annually in “Critical Accounting Estimates.” Discussion of these factors is incorporated by
reference from Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this document, and should be considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For additional information concerning factors
that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on Form 10-K, 10-Q
and 8-K filed with the SEC from time to time.
<47> Item 1A.
<48> Risk Factor s.
Provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the Company.
<49> Discussion
of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions .The Company
operates in more than 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States.
<50> The Company’s
business is subject to global competition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other
countries that are beyond its control, such as slower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of
either contained or widespread recessionary
10

Table of Contents
conditions, inflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government deficit reduction and other austerity
measures in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in
specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or climate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and
suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate
earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.
<51> * Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.
<52> The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of
capital.
<53> The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M.
<54> This evaluation is based
on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and
timeliness of financial reporting.
<55> 3M currently has an AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A1 credit
rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service.
<56> In March 2016, Moody’s downgraded 3M’s rating from Aa3 to A1, revised
3M’s outlook from negative to stable, and affirmed the Company’s short-term rating of P-1.
<57> This ratings action followed 3M’s
announcement of its new five-year plan for the period 2016 through 2020 in which the Company communicated its intent to further increase
financial leverage.
<58> The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders.
<59> The
Company’s ongoing transition to a better-optimized capital structure, financed with additional low-cost debt, could impact 3M’s credit
rating in the future.
<60> Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the Company’s cost of funding and could
adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
<61> * The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences.
<62> Demand for the Company’s products, which
impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the
Company’s response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of
inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in
the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our
products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the
demand for some of the Company’s products.
<63> * Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its
sales and earnings.
<64> Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the
Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected
growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
<65> * The Company’s growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its
ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market.
<66> This ability may be adversely affected by
difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property
protection, or gain market acceptance of new products.
<67> There are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
<68> * The Company’s future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials
and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency
exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors.
<69> The Company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy
(including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products.
<70> It is possible that any of its
supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future.
<71> Any sustained
interruption in the Company’s receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
<72> In addition, while the
Company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the Company will be able
to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.
<73> * Acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving
business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results.
<74> The
11

Table of Contents
Company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic
alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure.
<75> With respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the
Company’s ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.
<76> * The Company’s future results may be affected if the Company generates fewer productivity improvements than estimated.
<77> The Company
utilizes various tools, such as Lean Six Sigma, and engages in ongoing global business transformation.
<78> Business transformation is defined
as changes in processes and internal/external service delivery across 3M to move to more efficient business models to improve operational
efficiency and productivity, while allowing 3M to serve customers with greater speed and efficiency.
<79> This is enabled by the ongoing multi-
year phased implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis.
<80> There can be no assurance that all of the
projected productivity improvements will be realized.
<81> * The Company employs information technology systems to support its business, including ongoing phased implementation of an ERP
system as part of business transformation on a worldwide basis over the next several years.
<82> Security breaches and other disruptions to the
Company’s information technology infrastructure could interfere with the Company’s operations, compromise information belonging to the
Company and its customers, suppliers, and employees, exposing the Company to liability which could adversely impact the Company’s
business and reputation.
<83> In the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on information technology networks and systems, some of
which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business
processes and activities.
<84> Additionally, the Company collects and stores certain data, including proprietary business information, and may
have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and
customer-imposed controls.
<85> Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and
systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company’s information
technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches,
employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, service providers
including cloud services, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.
<86> It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an
extended period, up to and including several years.
<87> While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats
to the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure, none of them to date has had a material impact to the Company.
<88> There may be other challenges and risks as the Company upgrades and standardizes its ERP system on a worldwide basis.
<89> Any such events
could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company’s
reputation, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.
<90> Although the Company maintains insurance coverage for various
cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.
<91> * The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our
results.
<92> The performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans.
<93> Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and relevant
legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the Company's funding obligations and adversely
impact its results of operations and cash flows.
<94> * The Company’s future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those
involving product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery,
anti-corruption, or other matters.
<95> The outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the Company’s expectations because the
outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict.
<96> Various factors or developments can lead the
Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters
previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant
regulatory developments or changes in applicable law.
<97> A future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future
charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.
<98> For a more
detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company and the

Financial Statements.

<100> Unresolved Staff Comment s.
None.
<101> Item 2.
<102> Propertie s.
3M’s general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in St. Paul, Minnesota.
<103> The Company
operates 81 manufacturing facilities in 29 states.
<104> The Company operates 122 manufacturing and converting facilities in 36 countries outside
the United States.
<105> 3M owns the majority of its physical properties.
<106> 3M’s physical facilities are highly suitable for the purposes for which they were designed.
<107> Because 3M is a global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business
segments.
<108> Item 3.
<109> Legal Proceeding s.
Discussion of legal matters is incorporated by reference from Part II, Item 8, Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of this
document, and should be considered an integral part of Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”
Item 4.
<110> Mine Safety Disclosures.
<111> Pursuant to Section 1503 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), the Company is required to
disclose, in connection with the mines it operates, information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters in its periodic
reports filed with the SEC.
<112> For the year 2016, the information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by
Section 1503(a) of the Act is included in Exhibit 95 to this annual report.
