Instructions:
1. Analyze the provided text where each sentence is annotated with a unique number in the format <1>, <2>, etc.
2. The text may include table data represented in plain text (i.e., without clear rows/columns). Identify and treat such content carefully while determining cohesive topics.
3. Identify groups of sentences that form semantically cohesive sections (i.e., related topics, concepts, or themes).
4. Each section should be substantial, ideally covering a few paragraphs to a few pages worth of content.
5. For each section, provide:
   - The starting sentence number
   - The ending sentence number
   - A short but descriptive title that reflects the section's main theme
6. Ensure the entire document is covered without overlaps between sections.

Return your output strictly in the following JSON format:
[
    {
        "start_sentence": 1,
        "end_sentence": 15,

- Use retrieved chunks for additional context
- Cross-reference with useful info for validation

**Scenario 2: Only Retrieved Data**
- Rely on useful info and chunks
- Acknowledge any limitations based on confidence score
- Provide analysis within available data constraints

**Scenario 3: Low Confidence Data**
- Begin with confidence qualifiers
- Present available information with appropriate caveats
- Suggest areas where more current data might be needed

### Error Handling:
- If tool results contradict retrieved data, favor tool results (more current)
- If confidence score is very low (<0.4), clearly state data limitations
